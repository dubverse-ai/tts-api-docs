## Emotional Sentences Test

| Sentence | Audio |
|----------|-------|
| I can't believe it! This is amazing! | <audio controls src="https://dubverse-webapp.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/speaker_comparison/ElevenLabs_2024-10-07T10_16_20_Charlotte_pre_s50_sb75_se0_b_m2.mp3"></audio> |
| Oh my gosh, did you see that? | <audio controls src="https://dubverse-webapp.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/speaker_comparison/ElevenLabs_2024-10-07T10_16_20_Charlotte_pre_s50_sb75_se0_b_m2 (1).mp3"></audio> |

**Note**: ElevenLabs demonstrates a high pitch issue, especially for female voices, which can sound unnatural in emotional contexts.

## Why Choose Dubverse?

1. **Superior Hindi Support**: Dubverse outperforms competitors in handling complex Hindi sentences with clear pronunciation and natural intonation.

2. **Multilingual Capabilities**: Unlike some competitors, Dubverse excels in both Hindi and English, making it ideal for multilingual projects.

3. **Consistent Quality**: Dubverse maintains high audio quality across different sentence types and languages.

4. **Natural Speech Patterns**: Our TTS technology closely mimics human speech patterns, avoiding the robotic or electronic sound common in other solutions.

5. **Emotional Range**: While competitors struggle with emotional sentences, Dubverse can convey a wide range of emotions naturally.

6. **Balanced Speed**: Dubverse strikes the right balance between clarity and natural speech speed, unlike competitors that are either too slow or too fast.

7. **Versatility**: From simple greetings to complex tongue-twisters, Dubverse consistently delivers high-quality speech synthesis.

## Open Source Models

### Zonos

[Zonos](https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos) is an open-weight text-to-speech model trained on over 200k hours of multilingual speech data. While it shows promising capabilities, our evaluation reveals some important limitations to consider before production use.

#### Key Features
- Zero-shot voice cloning with 10-30s speaker samples
- Multilingual support (English, Japanese, Chinese, French, German)
- Fine-grained control over speaking rate, pitch, audio quality and emotions
- Real-time factor of ~2x on RTX 4090

#### Evaluation Results

Our testing revealed several areas that need improvement before production deployment:

1. **Audio Quality**
- Inconsistent speaker stability with occasional hallucinations
- Voice characteristics sometimes drift during longer utterances
- Generation errors can cause interruptions in output

2. **Expressiveness**
- While capable of emotional speech, results are inconsistent
- American male samples showed unintended "happy, chirpy tone"
- Faster speaking pace than intended in some dialogues

3. **Hallucination Issues**
- More prevalent in American male speaker compared to other voices
- Can manifest as unexpected voice changes mid-speech
- Affects overall reliability of the output

While Zonos demonstrates impressive capabilities for an open source model, these limitations make it better suited for experimental use rather than production applications where consistent, reliable output is critical.
