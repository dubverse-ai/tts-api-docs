# Obtaining Your API Key

Your API key is the gateway to accessing Dubverse's powerful Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities. This guide will walk you through obtaining and securing your API key.

## Generating Your API Key

Follow these steps to create your Dubverse API key:

1. **Access Your Dubverse Account**
   - Visit [https://webapp.dubverse.ai/](https://webapp.dubverse.ai/)
   - Log in with your credentials

2. **Navigate to the TTS API Section**
   - Look for "TTS API" in the main navigation menu
   - Click to access the TTS API dashboard

3. **Locate the API Key Management Area**
   - Find the section labeled "API Key"

4. **Generate Your New API Key**
   - Click the "Create Key" button
   - A new API key will be generated instantly

5. **Secure Your API Key**
   - Copy the displayed API key immediately
   - Store it in a secure location (we recommend using a password manager)

## Implementing Your API Key

To authenticate your requests to the Dubverse TTS API, include your API key in the header of each request:

X-API-Key: your_api_key_here


Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
