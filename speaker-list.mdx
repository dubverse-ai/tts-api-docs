## Using Speakers in API Calls

To use a specific speaker in your API call, include the `speaker_no` in your request body. For example:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello, welcome to Dubverse TTS!",
  "speaker_no": 251,
  "config": {
    "use_streaming_response": false
  }
}
```

For more information on how to select and implement speakers in your projects, please refer to our [Speaker Selection Guide](/api-reference/speaker-selection).

## Need a Custom Voice?
